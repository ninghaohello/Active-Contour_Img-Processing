# Active-Contour_Img-Processing

Chan-Vese model for image segmentation

Active contour for image segmentation is implemented using Chan-Vese energy function. Narrow-band method and various data strutures are applied here to speed up the evolution of active contour.

OpenCV should be pre-installed for code implementation.
